# What is the Chinese Remainder Theorem

The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is a powerful mathematical tool with origins dating back to ancient China. It provides a way to solve systems of simultaneous linear congruences with different moduli, particularly when the moduli are pairwise coprime. CRT has broad applications in number theory, cryptography, computer science, and more.

# Historical Background

The earliest known mention of the Chinese Remainder Theorem comes from the work of Chinese mathematician Sun Tzu, around the 3rd century AD. Sun Tzu posed a problem of determining an unknown number that, when divided by different divisors, leaves specific remainders. The solution to this problem laid the groundwork for the CRT, which was later formalized and generalized by European mathematicians like Carl Friedrich Gauss.

# The Mathematical Framework

CRT deals with systems of congruences of the form:
